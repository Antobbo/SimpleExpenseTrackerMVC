# SimpleExpenseTrackerMVC
Rework of pythonPracticeExpenses with a MVC pattern. 

This app will have the same functionality as the previous one in the 
pythonPracticeExpenses repository, which is, a simple expenses track app but it will follow the MVC pattern.

The data will still be stored in a csv for now.
